# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Sure, I'll create a separate documentation file, typically named `README.md`, which includes detailed documentation for each component and the overall project.

# Weather App Documentation

This is a simple weather application built using React and Material UI. It allows users to input a city and country to fetch the current weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the application, run:
```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Components

### Home Components

`Home.js` is the main component of the application. It sets up the layout and structure for the application and manages the state for weather results.

#### Props
- **None**

#### State
- **results**: Holds the weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Functions
- **setResults**: A setter function to update the `results` state.

#### Usage
The `Home` component renders an `AppBar`, a `Paper` component for the main content, a custom `Form` component for input, and an `Information` component to display the weather data.

### Form Component

`Form.js` is responsible for capturing user input for city and country and triggering the API call to fetch weather data.

#### Props
- **setResult**: A function passed down from the `Home` component to update the weather data state.

#### State
- **data**: An object that holds the user inputs for `city` and `country`.

#### Functions
- **handleChange**: Updates the `data` state based on user input.
- **getWeatherInfo**: Calls the `getWeather` function from the API service and updates the `results` state with the fetched data.

#### Usage
The `Form` component includes input fields for the city and country and a button to trigger the weather data fetch.

### Information Component

`Information.js` is used to display the weather data fetched from the API. It shows the location, temperature, humidity, sunrise, sunset, weather condition, cloudiness, and a summary.

#### Props
- **result**: The weather data object fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Functions
- **None**

#### Usage
The `Information` component renders a card with various weather details. If no data is present, it displays a default message prompting the user to enter a city or country.

## Services

### API Service

`api.js` contains the function to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Functions
- **getWeather**: Fetches weather data based on the provided city and country using the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Usage
The `getWeather` function is an asynchronous function that makes a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and returns the weather data.

## API Key

The API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. Ensure you have a valid API key and replace the placeholder in `api.js` with your actual key:

```javascript
const API_KEY = `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`;
```
